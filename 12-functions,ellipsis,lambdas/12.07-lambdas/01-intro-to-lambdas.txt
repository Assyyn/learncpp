 * A lambda expression (also called a lambda or closure) allows us to define an
 * anonymous function inside another function. The nesting is important, as it
 * allows us both to avoid namespace naming pollution, and to define the
 * function as close to where it is used as possible (providing additional
 * context).

    Lambdas take the form:
    [capture clause] (parameters) -> return_type
    {
        statements;
    }

    They don't have names

    A trivial lambda definition:
    []{};
