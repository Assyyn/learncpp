/* You are running a website, and you are trying to keep track of how much money
 * you make per day from advertising.
 * Declare an advertising struct that keeps track of how many ads youâ€™ve shown
 * to readers, what percentage of ads were clicked on by users, and how much you
 * earned on average from each ad that was clicked.
 * Read in values for each of these fields from the user.
 * Pass the advertising struct to a function that prints each of the values,
 * and then calculates how much you made for that day (multiply all 3 fields
 * together)*/
