// A typical class declaration:
class A
{
public:
    // something
private:
    // something
};

// Class (and struct) definitions are like a blueprint -- they describe what the
// resulting object will look like, but they do not actually create the object.
// To actually create an object of the class, a variable of that class type must
// be defined:
A x; // declare a variable of class A
