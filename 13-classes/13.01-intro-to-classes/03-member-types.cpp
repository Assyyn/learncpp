// more on nested types:
/* Nested types cannot be forward declared. Generally, nested types should only
 * be used when the nested type is used exclusively within that class. Note that
 * since classes are types, itâ€™s possible to nest classes inside other classes
 * -- this is uncommon and is typically only done by advanced programmers.*/
