// defining our game of blackjack:


1. The dealer gets one card to start (in real life, the dealer gets two, but one
   is face down so it doesn’t matter at this point).
2. The player gets two cards to start.
3. The player goes first.
4. A player can repeatedly “hit” or “stand”.
5. If the player "stands", their turn is over, and their score is calculated
   based on the cards they have been dealt.
6. If the player "hits", they get another card and the value of that card is
   added to their total score.
7. An ace normally counts as a 1 or an 11(whichever is better for the total
   score).
8. If the player goes over a score of 21, they bust and lose immediately.
9. The dealer goes after the player.
10. The dealer repeatedly draws until they reach a score of 17 or more, at which
    point they stand.
11. If the dealer goes over a score of 21, they bust and the player wins
    immediately.
12. Otherwise, if the player has a higher score than the dealer, the player
    wins. Otherwise, the player loses.
13. If both of them have the same score, the result is a tie and neither wins
