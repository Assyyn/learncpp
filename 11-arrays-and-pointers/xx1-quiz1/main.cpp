/* Question #1

Pretend youâ€™re writing a game where the player can hold 3 types of items: health
potions, torches, and arrows. Create an enum to identify the different types of
items, and an std::array to store the number of each item the player is carrying
(the enumerators are used as indexes of the array). The player should start with
2 health potions, 5 torches, and 10 arrows. Write a function called
countTotalItems() that returns how many items the player has in total. Have your
main() function print the output of countTotalItems() as well as the number of
torches.
