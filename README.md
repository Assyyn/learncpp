# A Documentation of My journey learning C++

The programs in this repository are written in C++ and are meant to be used as a reference for myself. I am not a professional programmer, and I am not a professional teacher. I am just a student who is learning C++ and documenting my journey. I am not a native English speaker, so please excuse any grammatical errors.

It is recommended that your compiler supports `C++17` or higher to build the programs, for *maximum* compatibility. I am using *gcc 12.2.0*.
The compilation flags (recommended) are:

- `-std=c++20 -Wall -Wextra -Wpedantic -Werror -ggdb` for debug builds.
- `-std=c++20 -Wall -Wextra -Wpedantic -Werror -O2 -DNDEBUG` for release builds.

While `C++17` is recommended, you *could* compile some programs using previous standards for sure. I am using `C++20` because I am using `std::ranges` in some programs.

I am open to any feedbacks, suggestions, and corrections. Please feel free to open an issue or a pull request. Anyone who could help me improve my code, and reorganize the repository is welcome.
