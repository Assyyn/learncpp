/* The current solution is non-optimal for a number of reasons.
First, we need to add a member to Animal for each way we want to differentiate
Cat and Dog. Over time, our Animal class could become quite large memory-wise,
and complicated!

Second, this solution only works if the base class member can be determined at
initialization time. For example, if speak() returned a randomized result for
each Animal (e.g. calling Dog::speak() could return ???woof???, ???arf???, or ???yip???),
this kind of solution starts to get awkward and fall apart.

Third, because speak() is a member of Animal, speak() will have the same
behavior for Cats and Dogs (that is, it will always return m_speak). If we
wanted speak() to have different behavior for Cats and Dogs (e.g. have Dogs
return a random sound), we???d have to put all that extra logic in Animal, which
makes Animal even more complex.
