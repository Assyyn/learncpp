// Showcasing dependencies

// A dependency occurs when one object invokes another objectâ€™s functionality in
// order to accomplish some specific task. This is a weaker relationship than an
// association, but still, any change to object being depended upon may break
// functionality in the (dependent) caller. A dependency is always a
// unidirectional relationship.

public:
    Something(int value = 0) : m_value{value} {}

    // std::ostream is a dependency of Something because it uses it in order to
    // accomplish the task of printing to the console, but not otherwise(as in
    // it is not directly related to std::ostream)

    {
        os << s.m_value;
